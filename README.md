# Architecture training

## Goal of the module

The participants know how a web application looks like under the hood. They are familiar with the layers of a web application architecture and the basic flows between them. They are familiar with REST, API, XML and JSON. They understand the difference between front-end and back-end, and know how different services can connect to each other (micro services). They understand the purpose of mocking and integration testing and practiced endpoint testing with REST assured.
